My idea for my app for the final project was going to be based off of this open source code from Android 5.1 that I imported into android studio
My intention was to reskin the game to include penguin and arctic elements like our first app we created, and include a few other features
However, I ran into some issues with my laptop over the weekend and ended up having to reinstall windows entirely, losing my small amount of progress made
Having to prepare myself for several other impending finals, including one for an Algebra class that I have a 60% in, I did not budget my time well enough to be able to do what I wanted with the app
For our discussion, I am prepared to give you an in depth analysis and walk you through the code of the original android easter egg, and discuss with you how I was going to implement my own features to it.
